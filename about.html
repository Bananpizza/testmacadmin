  <h1> First off, all thoughts, opinions are nobody elses than my own. </h1>
  <br/>I'm a simple man from the Swedish farmlands. Doing what I write about here for a living, MDM stuff.
  <br/>I like heavy music, and I like Apple products. Therefore the theme of this blog.
  <br/>When I'm not working, I spend time with my other (better) half, my cat, reading comics, fix things in the garden or with my house. I'm an avid gamer and love ARPG's and FPS games, currently playing a lot of Destiny 2. I love to spend time in my music studio making music, ranging all from electronic to blues to metal. Horror and thriller movies are things I love to watch.
